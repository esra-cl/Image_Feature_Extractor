# Image_Feature_Extractor
This tool allows users to take photos and apply either Local Binary Patterns (LBP) or Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to extract features from images. These feature extraction methods are widely used in various image processing and computer vision tasks, such as object recognition and face detection.
## Features 
Photo Capture or Image Selection: Users can capture a photo or select an image from their local machine. This allows users to collect their own dataset or extract features from an existing dataset.
Feature Extraction: Users can choose between LBP or HOG to extract features from images.
Feature Information Display: The tool provides detailed information about the extracted features, including histograms and feature vectors. It presents visual representations of feature distributions to help users to analyze the extracted data, also save it to text files.

## Dataset
The application can work with any grayscale or color images. Users can capture photos using the application or upload their own images for feature extraction.

## Methodology and requirements 
The methodology and the requirements for this project are given in the report.txt file.
